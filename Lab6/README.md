### Lab 6: Interrupts, Timing Behavior, & Stack Use ###

This lab introduces external interrupts and how they affect the CPU state, stack, and program timing on the STM32L552ZE microcontroller. It demonstrates how an interrupt service routine (ISR) can react to a hardware button press, update state, and toggle an RGB LED pattern. 
I also used oscilloscopes and debug tools to analyze CPU behavior during ISR execution.

**Learning Objectives**
Write an interrupt-driven program using an ISR and GPIO.

Understand interrupt triggering, NVIC configuration, and ISR execution.

Analyze the stack and register values when an interrupt occurs.

Use a logic analyzer/oscilloscope to examine ISR timing and latency.

Light an RGB LED based on a counter that changes each time a switch is pressed.

Using an oscilloscope or logic analyzer:

ISR latency is measured from switch press to ISR debug line activation.

Observed latency: ~24.8Âµs

The main program debug line (DBG_Main) drops during ISR execution, confirming CPU handover.

CPU and Stack Analysis
Registers like R0, R14 (LR), and R15 (PC) are inspected during ISR entry.

The Main Stack Pointer (MSP) stores context automatically during ISR entry.

Students analyze memory windows to track how register values are pushed/popped during context switch.
