### I've uploaded several folders outlining the lab assignments for my Microproccesor Course ###

The assignments tasked us with using an STM32 Board alongside the Keil environment. 

Topics covered include:
1) CPU Architecture & Initiliazation
2) Interrupts & NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)
3) GPIO
4) Timers & PWM Generation
5) ADC/DAC based sensor interfaces
6) Serial Communication (UART, I2C)
7) Real-time embedded applications

Tools & Environment

**Microcontroller:** Keil::NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q_BSP

**IDE:** Keil ÂµVision 5

**Languages:** C, ARM Assembly

**Debugger:** ST-Link V3

### Project Structure & Contribution Note

Each lab in this repository is based on template code provided as part of the course curriculum. In most cases, only specific files (typically `main.c` and other.c files) were edited to complete the assigned tasks, while the remaining source files were included as-is to preserve project structure and build functionality.


This project is for educational and portfolio use.
