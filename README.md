### I've uploaded several folders outlining the lab assignments for my Microproccesor Course ###

The assignments tasked us with using an STM32 Board alongside the Keil environment. 

Topics covered include:
1) CPU Architecture & Initiliazation
2) Interrupts & NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller)
3) GPIO
4) Timers & PWM Generation
5) ADC/DAC based sensor interfaces
6) Serial Communication (UART, I2C)
7) Real-time embedded applications

Tools & Environment
**Microcontroller:** Keil::NUCLEO-L552ZE-Q_BSP
**IDE:** Keil ÂµVision 5
**Languages:** C
**Debugger:** ST-Link V3

This project is for educational and portfolio use.
