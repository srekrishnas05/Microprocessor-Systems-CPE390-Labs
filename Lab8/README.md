### Lab 8 â€“ Digital Sound Synthesizer Using GPIO and Speaker ###

This lab demonstrates real-time audio generation using GPIO pins on the STM32L552ZE board. The user can dynamically adjust tone frequency and duration using hardware buttons, and waveforms are visualized using an oscilloscope. It also includes modifications in ARM Assembly.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

Generate square and rectangular waveforms using GPIO

Use buttons to interactively change tone frequency and duration

Interface a speaker circuit with capacitor and resistor filtering

Replace waveform logic with optimized ARM Assembly code

Visualize digital waveforms via oscilloscope
